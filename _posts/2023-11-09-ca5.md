### Introduction

memory hierarchy
    : A structure that uses **multiple levels** of memories. ; as the distance from the processor increases, the size of the memories and the access time both increase while the cost per bit decreases.

<div class="cf">

cf. *Why* is **memory hierarchy** crucial?

![Alt text](/images/ca5_processor-memory-improvement.png)

Even if the processor speed and memory latency are getting more and more improved, 
it still takes around 100+ CPU cycles for a DRAM access.

The hierarial structure is the key to improve this.

### DRAM Organization & Operation

#### DRAM configuration

*strobe*: A signal used to time reading that is output together with the data.

- Large capacity
  - Arranged as 2D matrix
- Narrow **data interface**: 1-16 bits (x1, x4, x8, x16)
  - Cheap packages => Few bus pins.
  - Pins are expensive.
- Narrow **address interface**
  - Multiplexed address strobe lines: *row* and *column* address
  - Signaled by *RAS*# and *CAS*#, respectively. (RAS: Row Address *Strobe*, CAS: Column Address *Strobe*)

![Alt text: Grid-like figure to represent how the DRAM is made up.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fslideplayer.com%2Fslide%2F5123576%2F&psig=AOvVaw19BNUcsYKAgKd7AP7gkF3X&ust=1701572539962000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCKDPle3h74IDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAI)

#### DRAM Organization

- DRAM: set of **banks**
- **bank**: independent memory request processing.
  - \# **bank**s == *parallelism degree*.
- Row buffer: bank-private **cache** area. (=> faster than DRAMs)
  - 4-16kB in size
  - **Shared** by all *CPU cores*
- (cf. Rank = 4-16 banks)

"각 bank에 동시에 access가 가능하면, spreading sequential data @ multiple banks is better."

#### DRAM Operations

(In? Column-first scheduling)

1) row-hit access
2) row-miss access

DRAM access scenario

- Three column reads to row 0, one col read to row 1.

Access scheduling sequence

| \# | RAS#? | CAS#? | Result |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | row-miss|
| 2 | 0 | 1 | row-hit |
| 3 | 1 | 2 | row-miss |
| 4 | 1 | 2 | row-miss |

Explanation

- 1. Row *miss*: ACT, row activation
  - We should have one miss at the initial data accesses.
  - Right after the miss, the corresponding data portion is filled into the buffer.
  - Here, we accessed the data of row 1 of the DRAM data for the first time.
- 2. Row *hit*: We already had an ACT in access to row0 col0. Thus, the row buffer stores the Row0, which then we can use to access it later.
- 3. Row *miss*: ACT, because we haven't loaded the Row1's data into the buffer.
  - Then we fill ? Buffer
- 4. Row miss: "ACT". Why??

In case of row-miss, the row buffer gets the data from the DRAM.

### Memory Hierarchy: Principle of Locality



### Caches

terms:

- temporal locality
  : The principle stating that if a location is referenced then it will tend to be referenced again soon.

- spatial locality
  : The locality principle stating that if a data location is

- memory hierarchy

principle of locality

Access Hits and Misses

- Hit: If accessed data is present in upper level.
  - Hit ratio: hits/accesss.
- Miss: If accessed data is absent in the upper level.
  - => Regenerate the access by copying it to the upper level.
  - Time taken: miss penalty: access to lower + access to upper
  - Miss ratio: misses/accesses
    - = 1 - hit ratio
- Then accessed data supplied from upper level
