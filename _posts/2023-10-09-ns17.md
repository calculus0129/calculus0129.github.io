### Introduction

"Affection : 감정"

Affective Neuroscience: The study of the neural basis of mood and emotion.

Terms:

- emotional experience (feelings)
- emotional expression ('emotional reaction')


### 1. Early Theories of Emotion

What exactly is the definition of the feelings of emotions?

**Darwin's observations**

: - People in *different* cultures experience the *same* emotions.
: - *animals* appear to express *some* of the *same* emotions as humans.

![Alt text](/images/ns17_animal-expression-of-emotions.png)

![Alt text](/images/ns17_facial-exp-of-emotions-in-humans.png)

#### 1.1. The James-Lange Theory

| A theory proposing that the **subjective experience** of emotion is a **consequence** of **physiological changes**(emotional expression) in the body. |

i.e. *emotional expression* causes *emotional experience*.

![Alt text](/images/ns17_FFR-JLT.png)

e.g. You **feel sad** when you **sense** that you are crying.

| - emotional expression : sense of my crying |
| - emotion : sadness |

#### 1.2. The Cannon-Bard Theory

| A theory of emotion proposing that <span class = "imp">emotional experience is **independent** of emotional expression</span> and is determined by the pattern of **thalamic activation**. |

![Alt text](/images/ns17_FFR-CBT.png)

##### Focus

- **thalamus** plays a special role in emotional sensations.
  - Emotion is devoid of *stimulus-response neural loop*.
    - *sensory input* is received by the cerebral cortex, which in turn *activates* certain changes in the body, independent of emotion.

  - Emotion production: Signals reach the thalamus
    - i.e. **pattern of activation** of the **thalamus** determines the **character of emotion**.
    - Neglecting the physiological response to the sensory input.

##### Difference with James-Lange Theory

1. emotions can be experienced even if physiological changes cannot be sensed.
   1. e.g. animal experiment
        : transection of the spinal cord.
        : => Eliminate body sensation, emotion is not abolished. (detected by muscular control.)
   2. e.g. human cases; transected spinal cord did not diminish emotion.
2. Lack of a reliable correlation between the exp of emotion and the physiological state of the body.
   
   e.g. fear: accompanied by...

    1. increased heart rate
    2. inhibited digestion
    3. increased sweating
   
   : However, the **same physiological changes also comes along with other conditions**.
    - anger (other emotion)
    - fever (nonemotional condition)

    => Fear being a consequence of the changes: absurd.

##### Illustration of the difference.

Crying and Sadness

- James-Lange Theory
  : - You feel sad as you sense that you are crying.
  : - Preventing the crying would perish the sadness.
- Cannon-Bard Theory
  : - You don't have to cry to feel sad.
  : - There simply has to be the appropriate activation of your thalamus in response to situation.

cf. It is difficult to study.

Difficulties in the study of emotion in animals
- cannot ask an animal how it feels.
- Can only measure its physiological or behavioral manifestations

#### 1.3. Implications of Unconscious Emotion

Terms

- unconscious emotion
    : The experience or expression of emotion in the absense of conscious awarenss of the stimulus that evoked the emotion.

Experiment:

| case | Perception | Conductivity of skin (high/low) (Reaction of the ANS) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Expressionless face | Expressionless face | low (no effect)
| Angry face + unplesant sound | Angry Face | high (increased skin conductance)
| 24장/1초 => 거의 안 보임. 여러 장 사진 중 딱 하나 Angry Face! | Expressionless Face (NOT angry!) | HIGH!

+ PET scan showed : inc skin conductance <-> amygdala activity.

=> Despite the faces are not perceived, the presentation of angry faces is both correlated with the **autonomic response** and **amygdala activity**.

Emotional **Experience** is **not always a prerequisite** for emotional **expression**.

### 2. The Limbic System

system : Collection of the components of a pathway.

e.g. parts of the *visual system* : work together to serve vision.
- lateral geniculate nucleus
- striate cortex

Is there a system that **processes the experiencing of emotions**?

Answer : limbic system (But this is not a single system)

Limbic system : 변연계

#### 2.1. Broca's Limbic Lobe

- limbic lobe
  : The hippocampus and cortical areas *bordering* the **brain stem** in mammals, which Broca proposed as a distinct lobe of the brain.<br><br>
  : cf. limbus : border, 경계.
  : cf. \(limbo : 연옥. 지옥가기 전에 가는 데라고 함\) in 기독교.


    예수님이 태어나기 전에 태어난 사람은 어디로 가는가? (예수에 의해 구원받는다는데)
    죽은 아기는 죄가 없는데 어디감?

    => 천국과 지옥의 **중간**, limbo

Components:

  - cortex around the *corpus callosum* ( mainly the **Cingulate gyrus** (좌/우뇌가 서로 맞닿아있는 영역 중 아랫쪽. 아주 중요함))
  - cortex on **Medial surface** of the **temporal lobe** (안쪽면)
  - cortex on Hippocampus (temporal lobe의 앞쪽의 안쪽의 옆면...)

![Alt text](/images/ns17_limbic-lobe.png)
![Alt text](/images/ns17_limbic-system.png)

Originally thought to have nothing to do with emotion. Primarily in olfaction. Connections with emotions were found later.

#### 2.2. The Papez Circuit

- papez circuit : A circuit of structures interconnecting the hypothalamus and cortex, proposed by Papez to be an emotion system.
- cf. fornix : A bundle of axons that originates in the hippocampal formation, loops around the thalamus, and terminates in the diencephalon.
- limbic system : A group of structures, including those in the limbic lobe and Papez circuit, that are anatomically interconnected and are probably involved in emotion, learning, and memory.

A number of limbic structures are involved in emotion (supported by evidence.)

- P1 : Hippocampus, fornix
- P2 : Anterior nuclei of thalamus

| role | handled by | input from | output tgt |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **emotional exprssion** | Hypothalamus | (P1)Hippocampus, fornix | (P2)Anterior nuclei of thalamus
| **emotional experience** | Cingulate Cortex (in CC) | *Neocortex*, (P2)Anterior nuclei of thalamus | *Neocortex*, (P1)Hippocampus, fornix
| **emotional coloring** (e.g. 같은 sad 중 강도에 따라, 같은 '기쁨'에 대해서도 어떤 일로 인해 느꼈는지를 구분.) | *Neocortex* | Cingulate Cortex (in CC) | Cingulate Cortex (in CC)

![Alt text](/images/ca17_papez-circuit.png)

- Note that the graph is circular. (i.e. has no starting point.)
    e.g. 공포를 느낌 => hippocampus => 땀흘림 => anterior nuclei of thalamus => 공포를 느낌 => ...

- It is also bidirectional => compatible with both the James-Lange & the Cannon-Bard theories of emotion.
 - James-Lange Theory : via (P2) Anterior nuclei of thalamus. (from the hypothalamus to cingulate cortex)
 - Cannon-Bard Theory : via (P1) Hippocampus and Fornix (from the cingulate cortex to the hypothalamus)

cf. Box 18.2 Phineas Gage

    전두엽 damage. => 감정에도 큰 변화가 일어났다.<br>
    * 교통사고 시 전두엽 이상은 주의깊게 살펴봐야 한다.
    * 의사결정, 집행, etc.

limbic system : Papez circuit (called by the similarities between the elements of the Papez circuit and Broca's limbic lobe.)

#### 2.3. Difficulties with the Concept of a Single System for Emotions

- Some of the structures in Broca's limbic lobe and the Papez circuit play a role in motion.
- Others are not critical for the motion (e.g. hippocampus)

Current Conclusion : There is not a single, discrete emotion system.
Instead, Several brain regions are involved in emotion, and these areas also mediate other functions.

(Structure and Function not one-to-one!)

cf. e.g. cingulate gyrus :
- emotion
- 초장기기억
