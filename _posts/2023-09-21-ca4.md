### 4.1. Introduction

Performance of a computer:
- instruction count (determined by the ISA and the compiler.)
- clock cycle time
- clock cycles per instruction (CPI).

**Implementation** of **the processor** determines both **the clock cycle time** and the number of **CPI**.

Construct the datapath and control unit for two different implementations of the MIPS instruction set.
- A simplified version
- A more realistic pipelined version.

'key question' in creating a **datapath** and designing the **control**: Examine implementations of...
- Memory reference instructions: lw, sw
- Arithmetic-logical instructions: add, sub, AND, OR, and slt
- Control transfer: beq, j

### 4.2. Logic Design Conventions

terms

- combinational & sequential(=state) element: An operational element such as an AND gate or an ALU. / A memory element. e.g. register or a memory.
- clocking methodology: The approach used to determine when data is valid and stable relative to the clock.
- edge-triggered clocking: A clocking scheme in which all state changes occur on a clock edge.
- control signal: A signal used for multiplexor selection or for directing the operation of a functional unit; contrasts with a data signal, which contains information that is operated on by a functional unit.
- asserted / deasserted : The signal is logically high or true / low or false.

#### from Appendix B.

##### B.2. Gates, Truth Tables, and Logical Equations

- asserted signal: A signal that is logically true, or 1.
- deasserted signal: A signal that is (logically) false, or 0.
- combinational logic: A logic system whose blocks do not contain memory and hence comput the same output given the same input.
- sequential logic: A group of logic elements that **contain memory** and hence whose value depends on the **inputs as well as the currnt contents of the memory**.
- gate: A device that implements basic logic functions, such as AND or OR.
  e.g. NOR gate, NAND gate.

##### B.3. Combinational Logic

- decoder: A logic block that has an n-bit input and $$2^{n}$$ outputs, where *only one output* is asserted for each input combination.
  e.g. 3-to-8 decoder, 5-to-32 decoder.
- multiplexor: A logic element that chooses from among the multiple sources and steers one of those sources to its destination. (combinational!)
- selector value (=**control value**): The control signal that is used to select one of the input values of a multiplexor as the output of the multiplexor.

#### Logic Design Basics

- Information encoded in binary.
  - Low voltage = 0, High Voltage = 1
  - One wire per bit.
  - Multi-bit data encoded on multi-wire buses.
- combinational element
  : An operational element. (Output doesn't depend on memory, but only on its inputs)<br>
  e.g. multiplexor, AND, OR, ALU
- State(sequential) element
  : A memory element (output depends on both internal state(memory) and inputs)<br>
  e.g. register, memory

### 4.3. Building a Datapath

terms:

- datapath element
  : A unit usd to operate on or hold data within a procssor. In the MIPS implementation, the datapath elements include the instruction and data memories, the register file, the ALU and adders.
- register file
  : A state element that consists of a set of registers that can be read and written by supplying a register number to be accessed.
- sign-extend
  : To increase the size of a data item by replicating the high-order sign bit of the original data item in the high-order bits of the larger, destination data item.
- branch target address
  : The address specified in a branch, which becomes the new program counter (PC) if the branch is taken. In the MIPS architecture the branch target is given by the sum of the offset field of the instruction and the address of the instruction following the branch.
- branch taken
  : A branch where the branch condition is satisfied and the PC becomes the branch target. All unconditional jumps are taken branches.
- branch not taken (or untaken branch)
  : A branch where the branch condition is false & the PC becomes the address of the instruction that sequentially follows the branch.
- delayed branch
  : A type of branch where the instruction immediately following the branch is always executed independent of whether the branch condition is T or F.

### 4.4. A Simple Implementation Scheme

terms

- truth table: From logic, a representation of a logical operation by listing all the values of the inputs and then in each case showing what the resulting outputs should be.
- don't-care term: An element of a logical function in which the output does not depend on the values of all the inputs. Don't-care terms may be specified in different ways.
- opcode: The field that denotes the operation and format of an instruction.
- single-(/single clock) cycle implementation: An implementation in which all instructions are executed in one clock cycle. While easy to understand, it is too slow to be practical.

The ALU control lines and the corresponding function

| ALU control lines | Function |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0000 | AND |
| 0001 | OR |
| 0010 | add |
| 0110 | subtract |
| 0111 | set on less than |
| 1100 | NOR |

bit# | Signal name | Effect when deasserted(0) | Effect when asserted(1) |
:---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
1 | PCSrc | The PC is replaced by the output of the adder that computes the value of **PC + 4**. | The PC is replaced by the output of the adder that computes the **branch target**.
1 | MemtoReg | The value fed to the *register Write data* input comes from the **ALU**. | The value fed to the *register write data* input are replaced by the value on the **(memory) Write data input**. |
1 | MemWrite | None | Data memory contents designated by the address input are **replaced** by the value on the *Write data* input. |
1 | MemRead | None | Data memory contents designated by the address input are put on the **Read data output**. |
1 | RegWrite | None | The register on the *Write register* input is **written** with the value on the *Write data* input. |
1 | RegDst | The register destination number for the *Write register* comes from the rt field (bits 20:16). | The register destination number for the *Write register* comes from the rd field (bits 15:11). |
2 | ALUOp | Refer to figure 4.13.
1 | ALUSrc | 2nd operand of the ALU becomes the second register file (Read data 2). | 2nd operand of the ALU becomes the 32bit sign-extended immediate field(lower 16 bits of the instruction). |

(NO RegRead as we must always read the register or writting control of the PC.)

Then, now we replace the PCSrc with Branch.

1 bit, and is 'AND'ed with the Zero from the ALU to determine the PCSrc. We no longer discuss the PCSrc as a signal from the control as it is now known as a *derived signal*.

### 4.6. An Overview of Pipelining

terms

- pipelining: An implementation technique in which multiple instructions are overlapped in execution, much like an assembly line.

자 laundry를 pipeline 돌려본다고 생각하자.

non-pipelined approach:

1. Place one dirty load of clothes in the washer.
2. When the washer is finished, plac th wed load in the dryer.
3. When the dryer is finished, place the dry load on a table and fold.
4. When folding is finished, ask your roommate to put the clothes away.

이게 non-pipelined approach이고,

- structural hazard: When a planned instruction **cannot execute in the proper clock cycle** because the hardware **does not support the combination of instructions** that are set to execute.
- data hazard (= pipline data hazard): When a planned instruction cannot excute in the proper clock cycle because **data** that is **needed to execute the instruction** is **not yet available**.
- forwarding (= bypassing): A method of resolving a data hazard by retrieving the missing data element from internal buffers rather than waiting for it to arrive from programmer-visible registers or memory.
- load-use data hazard: A specific form of data hazard in which th data being loaded by a load instrcution has not yet become available when it is neded by anothr instruction
- pipeline stall(=bubble): A stall initiated in order to resolve a hazard.
- control hazard (= branch hazard): When the proper instruction cannot execute in the proper pipeline clock cycle because the instruction that was fetched is not the one that is needed; that is, the **flow of instruction addresses** is not what the pipeline expected.
- branch prediction: A method of resolving a branch hazard that assumes a given outcome for the branch and proceeds from that assumption rather than waiting to ascertain th actual outcome.



Hazards

1. Structure Hazards
   A required resource is busy.

nyum nyum a bit later.

2. Data Hazard
   Need to wait for previous instruction to complete its data read/write.

When a planned instruction cannot xcute in the proper clock cycle because the needed data to execute the instruction is not yet available.

How to solve?
- Naive approach: The SW\(Compiler\) stalls the pipeline.

```asm
add $s0, $t0, $t1
sub $t2, $s0, $t3
```

Disadvantages: We have to waste 3 cycles.(as the WB must be done before ID of the next instruction) This happenes too often.


Better Solution: The Hardware **forwards** the data.
  : Add an extra hardware to retrieve the missing item early from the internal resources.

i.e. **forward** the data sending path from the first instruction's EX to the next instruction's ID. => get $s0 with only 1-cycle stall!

forwarding/bypassing
  : A method of resolving a data hazard by retrieving the missing data element from internal buffers rather than waiting for it to arrive from programmer-visible registers or memory.

Solution?

ㅇㅇ From the Lec08-proc3(1) 표시 안 된 부분 or 그 전 prints.


3. Control Hazard
   Deciding on control action depends on previous instruction.




When does the Multi-cycle datapath perform better than single-cycles?

benefit : one instruction involves many "stages". (e.g. 30 stages => better performance.)

In this case, beneficial.

e.g. Single-cycle : T_c = 800ps, Pipelined => T_c = 200ps

speedup for n instructions

$$ nyum $$

Imbalanced time consumption of execution => 

spedup = throughput (*2, not *5).


### 4.7. Pipelined Datapath and Control

terms:

- latency (pipeline): The number of stages in a pipeline or the number of stages between two instructions during execution.

5 Steps:

1. IF : Instruction fetch from memory
2. ID : Instruction decode & register read
3. EX : Execute operation or calculate address
4. MEM : Access memory operand
5. WB : Write result back to register

| Instr | IF | ID | ALU op | Mem | RegWrite(WB) | Total Time |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| lw | 200 | 100 | 200 | 200 | 100 | 800 |
| sw | 200 | 100 | 200 | 200 |  | 700 |
| R-format | 200 | 100 | 200 | 200 | 100 | 800 |
| lw | 200 | 100 | 200 | 200 | 100 | 800 |
