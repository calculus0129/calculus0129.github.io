### 4.1. Introduction

Performance of a computer:
- instruction count (determined by the ISA and the compiler.)
- clock cycle time
- clock cycles per instruction (CPI).

**Implementation** of **the processor** determines both **the clock cycle time** and the number of **CPI**.

Construct the datapath and control unit for two different implementations of the MIPS instruction set.
- A simplified version
- A more realistic pipelined version.

'key question' in creating a **datapath** and designing the **control**: Examine implementations of...
- Memory reference instructions: lw, sw
- Arithmetic-logical instructions: add, sub, AND, OR, and slt
- Control transfer: beq, j

### 4.2. Logic Design Conventions

terms

- combinational & sequential element: Nyum.
- clocking methodology: The approach used to determine when data is valid and stable relative to the clock.
- edge-triggered clocking: A clocking scheme in which all state changes occur on a clock edge.
- control signal: A signal used for multiplexor slection or for directing the operation of a functional unit; contrasts with a data signal, which contains information that is operated on by a functional unit.
- asserted / deasserted : The signal is logically high or true / low or false.

#### from Appendix B.

##### B.2. Gates, Truth Tables, and Logical Equations

- asserted signal: A signal that is logically true, or 1.
- deasserted signal: A signal that is (logically) false, or 0.
- combinational logic: A logic system whose blocks do not contain memory and hence comput the same output given the same input.
- sequential logic: A group of logic elements that **contain memory** and hence whose value depends on the **inputs as well as the currnt contents of the memory**.
- gate: A device that implements basic logic functions, such as AND or OR.
  e.g. NOR gate, NAND gate.

##### B.3. Combinational Logic

- decoder: A logic block that has an n-bit input and $$2^{n}$$ outputs, where *only one output* is asserted for each input combination.
  e.g. 3-to-8 decoder, 5-to-32 decoder.
- multiplexor: A logic element that chooses from among the multiple sources and steers one of those sources to its destination. (combinational!)
- selector value (=**control value**): The control signal that is used to select one of the input values of a multiplexor as the output of the multiplexor.

#### Logic Design Basics

- Information encoded in binary.
  - Low voltage = 0, High Voltage = 1
  - One wire per bit.
  - Multi-bit data encodd on multi-wire buses.
- combinational element
  : An operational element. (Output doesn't depend on memory, but only on its inputs)<br>
  e.g. multiplexor, AND, OR, ALU
- State(sequential) element
  : A memory element (output depends on both internal state(memory) and inputs)<br>
  e.g. register, memory
