### 3.1. Introduction

### 3.2. Addition and Subtraction

Algorithm: nyumnyum

Overflow Condition:

- (+) + (-) -> No overflow.
- (+) + (+) -> MSB == 1
- (-) + (-) -> MSB == 0

Integer Subtraction
- Add negation of second operand.
- e.g. 7 - 6 = 7 + (-6)

Nyum.

- C ignore overflow
  - Use MIPS addu, addui, subu instructions.
- Ada, Fortran require raising an exception.
  - Use MIPS add, addi, sub instructions

u: NO exception

ilban: exception (overflow)

cf. Exception step?
- Save PC in *exception program counter* (EPC) register
- Jump to predefined handler address.
- mfc0 (move from coprocessor reg) instruction can retrieve EPC value, to return after corrctive action.
