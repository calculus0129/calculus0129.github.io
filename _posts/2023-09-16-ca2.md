### 2.1. Introduction

컴퓨터 하드웨어에 명령을 내리기 위해, 우리는 하드웨어의 언어를 할 줄 알아야 한다.

instruction: Words of a computer's language.<br>
<a id="r1" class="links" href="#w1" title="instruction set: The vocabulary of commands understood by a given architecture">[1]</a><u>instruction set</u>: Vocabulary of computer.

instruction set Example:<br>
RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer (contrasting concept: CISC)

e.g. MIPS, ARM, Power PC, etc.

Computer "Architecture" defines...
- Instruction Set Architecture
  - Instruction Set
  - Operand types
  - Data Types (integers, FPs, ...)
  - Memory addressing modes, ...
- Registers and other state
- The interrupt/exception model
- Memory management and protection
- Virtual and physical address layout
- IO model

Chapter Goal<br>
: Know how to represent instructions.

Overview<br>
1. Learn how to represent instructions.
2. Discover the <a id="r2" class="links" href="#w2" title="stored-program concept: The idea that instructions and data of many types can be stored in memory as numbers, leading to the stored program computer.">[2]</a><u>stored-program concept</u>
3. Exercise the "forieign language" skills by writing Assembly programs & running them on the simulator that comes with this book.
4. See the impact of programming languages and compiler optimization on prformance.
5. Historical evolution of instruction sets.

### 2.2. Operations of the Computer Hardware

<span class="cf">The MIPS instruction set</span>
 - Used as the example throughout the book.
 - Stanford MIPS commercializd by MIPS technologies <www.mips.com>
 - Typical of many modern ISAs.
 - Similar ISAs have a large share of embedded core market.
   - Applications in consumer eletronics, network/storage equipment, cameras, printers, ...
   - Almost 100 million MIPS processors manufactured in 2002.

| Category | Instruction | Example | Meaning | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arithmetic | add | add $s1,$s2,$s3 | $s1 = $s2 + $s3 | Three register operands |
| Arithmetic | subtract | sub $s1,$s2,$s3 | $s1 = $s2 - $s3 | Three register operands |
| Arithmetic | add immediate | addi $s1,$s2,20 | $s1 = $s2 + 20 | Used to add constants |
| Data transfer | load word | lw $s1,20($s2) | $s1 = Memory\[$s2+20\] | Word from memory to register |
| Data transfer | store word | sw $s1,20($s2) | Memory\[$s2+20\] = $s1 | Word from register to memory |
| Data transfer | load half | lh $s1,20($s2) | $s1 = Memory\[$s2+20\] | Halfword memory to register |
| Data transfer | load half unsigned | lhu $s1,20($s2) | $s1 = Memory\[$s2+20\] | Halfword memory to register |
| Data transfer | store half | sh $s1,20($s2) | Memory\[$s2+20\] = $s1 | Halfword register to memory |
