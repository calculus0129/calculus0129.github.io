| Category | Instruction | Example | Meaning | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arithmetic | add | add $s1,$s2,$s3 | $s1 = $s2 + $s3 | Three register operands |
| Arithmetic | subtract | sub $s1,$s2,$s3 | $s1 = $s2 - $s3 | Three register operands |
| Arithmetic | add immediate | addi $s1,$s2,20 | $s1 = $s2 + 20 | Used to add constants |
| Data transfer | load word | lw $s1,20($s2) | $s1 = Memory\[$s2+20\] | Word from memory to register |

<span class="highlight">Fixation of operand #s in arithmetic operators (as 3)</span> demonstrates regularity.

This illustrates first of the three underlying principles of hardware design:

# HW Design Principle 1

| Design Principle 1: Simplicity favors regularity. |

(form of arithmetic operations)
- Regularity makes implementation simpler
- Simplicity => high perf / low cost


Example: Changing the below C code into Assembly.
```c
f = (g + h) - (i + j);
```

Compiled MIPS code (Assembly)
- $s0: f
- $s1: g
- $s2: h
- $s3: i
- $s4: j

<!--https://computer-science-student.tistory.com/366-->

```asm
add $t0, $s1, $s2 # temp t0 = g + h
add $t1, $s3, $s4 # temp t1 = i + j
sub $s0, $t0, $t1 # f = t0 - t1
```


### 2.3. Operands of the Computer Hardware

- registers: limited number of special locations built directly in hardware.
- <a id="r3" class="links" href="#w3" title="word: The natural unit of access in a computer, usually a group of 32 bits; corresponds to the size of a register in the MIPS architecture.">[3]</a><u>word</u>: Unit of access in a computer; corresponds to the size of a register in the MIPS architecture.
- MIPS has a 32 * 32-bit register file. => word: 32 bits

# HW Design Principle 2

| Smaller is faster. |

The reason for the limit of 32 registers:<br>
Large number of register => Increase clock cycle time<br>
∵ it takes longer electronic signals.

#### Memory Operands

- <a id="r4" class="links" href="#w4" title="data transfer instruction: A command that moves data between memory and registers">[4]</a><u>data transfer instruction</u>: 
  - load: Copies data from memory to a register.
  - store: Complementary D.T.I. to load: copies data from a register to a memory.
- <a id="r5" class="links" href="#w5" title="address: A value used to delineate the location of a specific data element within a memory array.">[5]</a><u>address</u>: A value denoting the location of a specific data element within a memory array.
- MIPS uses **byte addressing**: 1 Address difference leads to 1 byte location difference in memory.
- <a id="r6" class="links" href="#w6" title="">[6]</a><u>Alignment restriction</u>: Word must start at addresss that are multiples of 4.


- Base address: Starting address (of an array)
- Base register: The register added to an offset to form an address (i.e. representing base address.)
- Offset: The constant in a data transfer instruction.

Example:
```c
g = h + A[8];
```
- g: $s1
- h: $s2
- A: Array of 100 words.
- <u>Base register</u> storing <u>base address</u> of A: $s3.

```
lw $t0, 32($s3) # Temp reg $t0 gets A[8]
add $s1, $s2, $t0 # 
```

Example:
```c
A[12] = h + A[8];
```
- h: $s2
- Base Address of A at : $s3.

```
lw $t0, 32($s3) # Temp reg $t0 gets A[8]
add $t0, $s3, $t0
sw $t0, 48($s3)
```

<span class = "imp">Q. Why using base register is beneficial?</span>

A. We can <span class = "imp">address wider range of memory</span>.

- Using only 5 bits of instruction to stress the base register, we can address 2^32 byts of memory,
- whereas merely 2^5 bytes would be addressible did we use it not as base register, but as the address itself.

<span class="cf">cf. Concepts</span>
- Endianness:
  - Big endian: Put most-significant byte at least address of a word.
  - Little endian: Put least-significant byte at least address of a word.
- spilling registers: Process of putting less commonly used variables into memory.
- Registers (than memory):
  - Less access time
  - Higher throughput
  - Less energy

=> Compilers must use registers efficiently.
<span class="cf">\cf</span>


#### Constants or Immediate Operators

***common case fast: Using frequency to justify the inclusions of constants.***

- Small constants are common.
- Immediate operand avoids a load instruction.

- addi: Avoid the load instructions from constant numbers to add a constant.
- $zero: Value zero.

```
addi $s3, $s3, 4 # $s3 = $s3 + 4
```

<span class="cf">cf. MIPS supports negative consts => No need for subi.</span>

### 2.4. Signed & Unsigned Numbers

Meh, You know.

Terms:
- binary digits
- least significant bit
- most significant bit
- overflow

MIPS instructions
- lb (I format)
- lbu (I format) e.g. Representing characters.

- 2's complement: Unsigned sum of an n-bit int and its n-bit negative is 2^n. Sign bit == MSB in this case.
  - sign extension: 
    - Converting m bit integer to n(>m) bit integer.
    - Signed: Replicate the most significant bit to the left.
    - <span class="cf">Unsigned: Extend with 0s.<span>
  - negation: 
    - x: signed int.
    - $$\bar{x}$$: every bit inverted of x.
    - $$ x + \bar{x} = -1 $$
    - $$ ∴ -x = \bar{x} + 1 $$

### 2.5. Representing Instructions in the Computer

#### Terms

- <span class="cf">field: Certain segments of instructions.</span>
- instruction format: A form of reprsentation of an instruction composed of fields of binary numbers.
- machine language: Binary representation usd for communication within a computer system.
- hexadecimal: Numbers in base 16.
- opcode: The field that denotes the operation & format of an instruction.

#### Instruction Formats

regularity: All instructions encoded as 32-bit instruction words.

Different formats complicate decoding, but <span class="highlight">commonly allow 32-bit instructions</span>.

# HW Design Principle 3

| Design Principle 3: Good design demand good compromises |

- R-type(=R-format) (R: Register)
  - Instruction Fields
    ![| opcode(6) | rs(5) | rt(5) | rd(5) | shamt(5) | funct(6) |](/images/ca2_R-format.png)
    - op: operation code (opcode)
    - rs: first source register number
    - rt: second src register num
    - rd: destination register num
    - shamt: shift amount (00000 for now)
    - funct: function code (extends opcode)
  - Examples:
    - Arithmetic ops.
- I-type(/format) (for immediate)
  - Instruction Fields
    ![| opcode(6) | rs(5) | rt(5) | immediate(16) |](/images/ca2_I-format.png)
  - Examples:
    - Immediate arithmetic ops
    - load/store instructions
  - Usage:
    - rs: base register or **second** operand of assembly.
    - rt: the register (that stores the result) or **first** operand of assembly.
    - immediate: const(-2^15 to 2^15 - 1) or address(offset added to base address in rs.)
- J-type(/format) (J: Jump)
  - Instruction Fields
    ![| opcode(6) | address(26) |](/images/ca2_J-format.png)
  - Examples:
    - Jump Instructions (j and jal)
      - Address: encode 26-bit target address
      - jal: save the address of the nxt(=following) instruction in $ra and jump to an address.

Example:

Convert this into the corresponding MIPS machine instruction.

``` add $t0, $s1, $s2 ```

Solution:
- add is R-format. OPCODE/FUNCT: 0/20(hex)
- Therefore the fields are as follows:
  - opcode: 0
  - **rs: $s1**
  - rt: $s2
  - **rd: $t0**
  - shamt: 0
  - funct: 20 (hex)
Thus the machine code would be as follows:

000000 10001 10010 01000 00000 100000

(0000 0010 0011 0010 0100 0000 0010 0000)
as hex, 0232 4020

Example:

- C code
  ```c
  A[300] = h + A[300];
  ```
- Assembly code (A: 4-byte array, base addr in $t1, h: $s2)
  ```
  lw $t0, 1200($t1)
  add $t0, $s2, $t0
  sw $t0, 1200($t1)
  ```
- Machine code
  - Instructions and formats
    - add: R
    - lw, sw: I
  - Fields:
    - add:
      - opcode/funct: 0/32
      - rs: $s2 => 18
      - rt: $t0 => 8
      - rd: 8
      - shamt: 0
    - lw, sw:
      - opcode: 35, 42
      - rs: $t1 (base reg!) => 9
      - rt: $t0 (just reg!) => 8
      - immediate: 1200.

    | operation | op | rs | rt | rd | shamt | funct |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | add | 0 | 18 | 8 | 8 | 0 | 32 | 
    | lw | 35 | 9 | 8 | 1200 |
    | sw | 43 | 9 | 8 | 1200 |
  
  lw->add->sw.

  | 100011 | 01001 | 01000 | 0000 0100 1011 0000 |
  | 000000 | 10010 | 01000 | 01000 | 00000 | 100000 |
  | 101011 | 01001 | 01000 | 0000 0100 1011 0000 |

Example:

```
addi $s1, $s2, 100
```

| opcode | rs | rt | immediate |
| 8 | 18(for $s2) | 17(for $s1) | 100 |



### 2.6. Logical Operators

Terms:
- AND: A logical bit-by-bit operation with two operands that calculates a 1 only if thre is a 1 in both operands.
  - Application: Mask bit in a word (select some bits, clear others to 0)
- OR: A logical bit-by-bit operation with two operands that calculates a 1 if there is a 1 in either operand.
  - include bits in a word.
- NOT: A logical bit-by-bit operation with one operand that inverts the bits; that is, it replaces every 1 with a 0 and every 0 with a 1.
- NOR (NOT OR): A logical bit-by-bit operation with two operands that calculates the NOT of the OR of the two operands. That is, it calculates a 1 only if there is a 0 in both operands.
- cf. XOR: A binary bit operation that returns 1 iff the two bits differ.

Ops:
- sll: shift left logical **(R)**
  - **rs=0 (unused)**
  - e.g. sll $t2, $s0, 4 => $t2 = $s0 << 4. (sllop 0 16 10 **4 (shamt)** sllfunc)
- srl: shift right logical
- and, andi: and. nyum.
  - and (R) (e.g. and $t0 $s1 $s2 nyum nyum) (nyum. andop 17 18 8 0 andfunc)
  - andi (I) (e.g. andi $s1 $t0 24 => nyum nyum) (nyum. andiop 8 17 24. )
- or, ori
- nor(R): A NOR B == NOT (A OR B)
  - * noring an argument with 0 leads to not.

### 2.7. Instructions for Making Decisions

Terms: 
- conditional branches: An instruction that requires the comparison of two values and that allows for a subsequent transfer of control to a new address in the program based on the outcome of the comparison.
- basic block: A sequence of instructions without...
  - branches (except possibly at the end) and
  - branch targets or branch labels (except possibly at the beginning).
- <span class="cf">jump == unconditional branches </span>
- jump (address) table: A table of addresses of alternative instruction sequences.

Ops:
- beq rs, rt, L1 (**I**)
  - if rs == rt, then Branch to instruction labeled L1.
- bne rs, rt, L1
  - if rs != rt, then Branch to instruction labeled L1.
- j L1
  - Unconditional jump to instruction labeled L1.
- Comparison instructions (4)
  - slt (set less than) rd, rs, rt
    - if(rs < rt) rd = 1; else rd = 0;
  - slti rt, rs, const
  - sltu (nyum.)
    - Special usage: index-out-of-bounds checking.
    - e.g.
      ```
      # see if $t0 < $s1 and $t0 >= 0, where $s1 > 0. Else, out-of-bound.
      sltu $t1, $t0, $s1
      beq $t1, $zero, IndexOutOfBounds
      ```
  - sltiu (nyum)

### 2.8. Supporting Procedures in Computer Hardware

Terms:
- procedure ('function'): A stored subroutine that performs a specific task based on the parameters with which it is provided.
- jump-and-link instruction: An instruction that jumps to an address and simultaneously saves the address of the following instruction in a register($ra in MIPS).
- return address: A link to the calling site that allows a procedure to return to the proper address; in MIPS it is stored in register $ra.

- caller: The program that instigates a procedure and provides the necessary parameter values.
- callee: A procedure that executes a series of stored instructions based on parameters provided by the caller and then returns control to the caller.
- program counter (PC): The register containing the address of the instruction in the program being executed.
- stack: A data structure for spilling registers organized as a last-in-first-out queue.
  - push: Add element to stack.
  - pop: Remove element from stack.
- stack pointer: A value denoting the most recently allocated address in a stack that shows where registers should be spilled or where old register values can be found. In MIPS, it is register $sp.

- global pointer: The register that is reserved to point to the static area.
- procedure frame(= activation record): The segment of a stack containing a procedure's saved registers and local variables.
- frame pointer: A value denoting the location of the saved registers and local variables for a given procedure.
- text segment: Th segment of a UNIX object file that contains the machine language code for routines in the source file.

Concepts

#### Procedure Calling Step

1. Caller places params in argument registers for the procedure(callee).
   * $a0-$a3: Argument registers to pass params.
2. Caller transfer control to the callee. (This also assigns $ra the next instruction.)
   * jal Func
3. Callee acquires storage resources for the procedure
   * addi $sp, $sp, -4*n
4. Callee performs the desired task.
5. Callee puts the return value in value registers for the caller.
   * $v0-$v1: Value registers to return result values.
6. Callee returns control to the caller.
   * Done by: jr $ra.

Instructions
- jr: jump to a register specified. e.g. $ra.
- jal: jump-and-link. Jumps to an address and simultaneously saves the address of the following instruction in a register ($ra in MIPS)

#### Nested Procedures (non-leaf procedures)

: procedures that call others.

For nested calls, the *caller* needs to save on the stack:
- Its return address
- Any arguments and temporaries needed after the call.

Restore from the stack after the call.

Note: Which register values must be preserved during a procedure call? [<a id="2.8" class="links" href="#rtbl2.8">reg table</a>]

- $s0-$s7
- $sp, $ra(, $fp, $gp) ( () : if used.)
(- stack above the stack pointer.)

#### Allocating Space for new Data on the Stack

How to save all the values of the registers that must be saved & can be modified?<br>
We simply use the memory section: stack.

- Allocation of space: just add -4(=word size)*(reg size) to the $sp.
- Location of space: address via ($sp + 4*n), etc. (or sometimes $fp-4\*n can be used.)
- Deallocate after loading the needed information back in the registers and restore $sp value.

Registers
- $ra (return address): A link to the calling site that allows a procedure to return to the proper address.
- $sp : A value denoting the most recently allocated address in a stack that shows whre registers should be spilled or where old register values can be found.
  - Stack GROWS from HIGHER to LOWER addresses.
- $fp: Points to the first word of the (stack) frame of a procedure. Used as a stable base register within a procedure for local memory references.

Example: Factorial Code

C code:
```c
int fact(int n) {
  if(n<1) return 1;
  else return n * fact(n-1);
}
```

- argument n in $a0
- result in $v0

MIPS code:
```
Fact:
  slti  $t0, $a0, 1
  bne $t0, $zero, Base
  addi $sp, $sp, -1
  sw $ra, 0($sp) # This must be done!
  addi $a0, $a0, -1
  jal Fact # Because of this! Non-leaf!
  lw $ra, 0($sp)
  addi $sp, $sp, 4
  addi $a0, $a0, 1
  mul $v0, $v0, $a0
  jr $ra
Base:
  addi $v0, $zero, 1
  jr $ra
```

#### Memory Layout

- Text: program code
- static data: global variables
  - e.g. static variables in C, constant arrays and strings
  - $gp initialized to address allowing ±offsets into this segment.
- dynamic data: heap

![Figure of the memory layout](/images/ca2_mem-layout.png)

### 2.9. Communicating with People

ASCII encoding: A representation of characters offered by most computers today.

characters are represented into integers 0-127 (7 bits). This consumes 1 byte.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII

MIPS Instructions: (for Byte/Halfword Operations: )

Sign extending loads
- lb rt, offset(rs)
- lh rt, offset(rs)

Zero extending loads
- lbu rt, offset(rs)
- lhu ret, offset(rs)

No extending store
- sb rt, offset(rs)
- sh rt, offset(rs)

Example: String Copy (null-terminated strings)

C code:
```c
void strcpy (char x[], char y[]) {
  int i;
  i = 0;
  while ((x[i]=y[i]) != '\0')
    i+=1;
}
```

- Addresses of x, y in $a0, $a1
- i in $s0

```
strcpy:
1 addi $sp, $sp, -1
2 sw $s0, 0($sp)
3 add $s0, $zero, $zero
Loop:
4 sll $t0, $s0, 2
5 add $t1, $t0, $a1 # addr of y[i]
6 add $t2, $t0, $a0 # addr of x[i]

7 lbu $t3, 0($t1)
8 sb  $t3, 0($t2)

9 beq $t3, $zero, Exit
10  addi $s0, $s0, 1
11  j Loop
Exit:
12  lw $s0, 0($sp)
13  addi $sp, $sp, 4
14  jr $ra
```

Q. The code above is a problematic code. Which line causes the problem?

A. the line 4. sll $t0, $s0, 2 causes a problem.<br>
This does not have to be done as each entry of the arrays is a char type, using one byte, not one word.<br>
You'd be able to simply correct the problem then.

### 2.10 MIPS Addressing for 32-bit Immediates & Addresses

Terms:
- PC-relative addressing: An addressing regime in which the address is the sum of the program counter (PC) and a constant in the instruction.

#### 32-Bit immediate Operands

MIPS Instructions: (for storing 32-bit constant)

- lui rt, imme: stores the immediate value to the upper(left) 16 bits of rt.

#### Branch Addressing

##### J-type

- op (6 bits)
- address (26 bits)

Target address = (PC+4's 31-28th bit) (**addr<<2**)

##### Branch Addressing

PC-relative addressing

- op
- rs
- rt
- imme

16 bits for ±offset(=imme) in word granularity (i.e. 2^15 words)

Target Address = (PC for next instruction) + offset * 4 \[byte\]

### 2.11 Parallelism and Instructions: Synchronization

Parallel excution is easier when tasks are independent, but often they need to cooperate.

Terms:
- data race: Two memory accesses form a data race if they are from different threads to same location, at least one is a write, and they occur one after another.

Critical ability for synchronization:<br>
*Atomically* read and modify a memory location.
- i.e. **Nothing else can interpose** itself between the read and the write of the memory location.

Could be a single instruction
- e.g. **Atomic swap of register <-> memory**.
- Or an atomic pair of instructions.

lock values:
- value 0: free
- value 1: locked (unavailable)

ll, sc

- ll: load linked

    ll $rt, imme($rs)

    : Stores Memory\[$rs+imme\] to the register $rt.
    : Also, the hardware internally memorize (address, value) of the Memory specified by $rs+imme. (e.g. via CPU configuration bit)

- sc: store conditional

    sc $rt, imme($rs)

    : Store register $rt value to the memory with address imme($rs). (IDK: if not stored if $rt below equals 0.)
    : $rt = the address specified by imme($rs) has the same value since the last ll to the address ? `1` : 0.

This ensures the atomicity of **writing** in the **memory** location specified by imme($rs).

e.g. atomic swap (in Ch.13) p.140

```Assembly
# Swapping contents of $s4 and the memory location specified by $s1
swap: add $t0,  $zero,  $s4 # copy exchange value
      ll  $t1,  0($s1)      # load linked ; load Mem[$s1] to register $t1, and let 'LM' map $s1 to the current value of Mem[$s1].
      sc  $t0,  0($s1)      # store conditional ; see if LM[$s1] == Mem[$s1].
                            # If true, then store $t0 value to Mem[$s1] and $t0 = 1.
                            # If false, then $t0 = 0.
      beq $t0,  $zero,  $swap # branch store fails
      add $s4,  $zero,  $t1 # put loaded value in $s4.

```

### 2.12 Translating and Starting a Program (partly covered in class.)

Terms:
- assembly language: A symbolic language that can be translated into binary machine language.
- pseudoinstruction: A common variabion of assembly language instructions often treated as if it were an instruction in its own right.
- symbol table: A table that matches names of labels to the addresses of the mmory words that instructions occupy.
- linker (=link editor): A systems program that combines independently assembled machine language programs and resolves all undefined labels into an executable file.
- executable file: A functional program in the format of an object file that contains no unresolved references. It can contain symbol tables and debugging information. A "stripped executable" dos not contain that information. Relocation information may be included for the loader.
- loader: A systems program that places an objct program in main memory so that it is ready to execute.
- dynamically linked libraries (DLLs): Library routines that are linked to a program during execution.
- Java bytecode: Instruction from an instruction st designed to interpret Java programs.
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM): The program that interpretes Java bytecodes.
- Just In Tim compiler(JIT): The name commonly given to a compiler that operates at runtime, translating the interpreted code segments into the native code of the computer.
