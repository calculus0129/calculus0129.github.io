### 서론

Conscious movements occur by the behavior which acts as the driving force on a behavior.<br>
Neuroscience cannot yet provide a detailed explanation on for why the sailing expedition was abandoned in favor of writing this chapter. Nonetheless, much has been learned about what motivates certain behaviors that are basic to survival.

### 1. The hypothalamus, homeostasis, and motivated behavior

The hypothalamic regulation of homeostasis occur as follows:

1. Sensory transduction.
- A regulated parameter (e.g. temperature) is measured by specialized sensory neurons.
- Deviations from the optimal range are detected by the neurons in the periventricular zone of hypothalamus.
1. 3 types of responses by hypothalamus to maintain bodily homeostasis
   1. Humoral response: stimulate/inhibit releasing pituitary hormones.
   2. Visceromoter response: adjusting the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic outputs of ANS.
   3. Somatic motor response: Hypothalamic neurons (particularly within lateral hypothalamus) incites an appropriate somatic motor behaviorial response.

| motivated behavior | Behavior that is incited to achieve a goal. <br><br> e.g. (by somatic motor system) to actively seek or generate warmth by moving, to drink water, & to eat. |

Chapter Goal:
- Explore the neural basis for this type of motivation.

To illustrate, focus on a subject: eating.

### 2. The long-term regulation of feeding behavior

#### 1. Energy Balance

Loading and emptying the body's energy reserve

2 kinds of reservoir: Glycogen and Triglycerides.

| substances | Location | Capacity |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| glycogen | skeletal muscle & liver | limited |
| triglycerides | adipose (fat) tissue | unlimited |

The energy homeostasis is maintained.

A possible mechanism: **Lipostatic hypothesis**.<br>
: The idea that the brain monitors the amount of body fat, acting to defend this energy store against perturbations.

For this hypothesis to be true, a necessary condition is the communication from body fat to feeding behavior, i.e., from the adipose tissue to the brain.

This is confirmed by Douglas Coleman as follows:

###### Studies from ob/ob mice

ob/ob mice (lacking both copies of a gene called ob): very obese, abnormally motivated to eat.

Coleman's hypothesis: The product from the ob gene may be the hormone telling the brain that fat reserves are normal('enough').

1. Parabiosis experiment (1906s, Coleman & his colleagues)
   - parabiosis: First introduced by the French physiologist Paul Bert in the 1860s.
   - parabiosed entities share a *common blood supply*.
   - an ob/ob and normal mice were parabiosed => Feeding behavior and obesity were **greatly reduced**.
  
   : The effects by missing hormone?
2. Effects of leptin (1994, Jeffrey Friedman @ Rockfeller Univ.)
   - leptin: The protein encoded by the ob gene.
     - Generation & Secretion: adipose cells (adipocytes)
     - Target: Neurons of the **arcuate nucleus** of the **hypothalamus**.
     - 'body fat is enough'
     - Result:
       - Decrease appetite
       - Increase energy expenditure
   - Leptin deficiency: Adaptive when food is scarce & E reserves are low.
     - stimulate hunger & feeding
     - suppress energy expenditure
     - inhibit reproductive competence

###### The Hypothalamus & Feeding

- Lesion Experiment (Dr. Hetherington & Dr. Ranson)
  Bilateral lesions of...
  - *Lateral* hypothalamus
    ❗단어들❗

    | 단어 | 뜻 |
    | --- | --- |
    | anorexia | a state of negative energy balance in which energy expenditure exceeds energy intake, with a severe damage to food appetite |
    | lateral hypothalamus syndrome | anorexia caused by damage to the lateral hypothalamus |

  - *ventromedial* hypothalamus
    ❗단어들❗

    | 단어 | 뜻 |
    | --- | --- |
    | ventromedial hypothalamus syndrome | overeating and obesity caused by lesions to the ventromedial hypothalamus |

Dual center model:
- Lateral hypothalamus: "hunger center"
- Ventromedial hypothalamus: "satiety center"

Too simplistic!
