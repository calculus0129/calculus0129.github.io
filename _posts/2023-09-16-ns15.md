### 서론

Conscious movements occur by the behavior which acts as the driving force on a behavior.<br>
Neuroscience cannot yet provide a detailed explanation on for why the sailing expedition was abandoned in favor of writing this chapter. Nonetheless, much has been learned about what motivates certain behaviors that are basic to survival.

### 1. The hypothalamus, homeostasis, and motivated behavior

The hypothalamic regulation of homeostasis occur as follows:

1. Sensory transduction.
- A regulated parameter (e.g. temperature) is measured by specialized sensory neurons.
- Deviations from the optimal range are detected by the neurons in the periventricular zone of hypothalamus.
1. <span class="imp">3 types of responses by hypothalamus to maintain bodily homeostasis</span>
   1. Humoral response: stimulate/inhibit releasing pituitary hormones.
   2. Visceromoter response: adjusting the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic outputs of ANS.
   3. Somatic motor response: Hypothalamic neurons (particularly within lateral hypothalamus) incites an appropriate somatic motor behaviorial response.

| motivated behavior | Behavior that is incited to achieve a goal. <br><br> e.g. (by somatic motor system) to actively seek or generate warmth by moving, to drink water, & to eat. |

Chapter Goal:
- Explore the neural basis for this type of motivation.

To illustrate, focus on a subject: eating.

### 2. The long-term regulation of feeding behavior

#### 2.1. Energy Balance

Loading and emptying the body's energy reserve

2 kinds of reservoir: Glycogen and Triglycerides.

| substances | Location | Capacity |

| glycogen | skeletal muscle & liver | limited |
| triglycerides | adipose (fat) tissue | unlimited |

The energy homeostasis is maintained.

A possible mechanism: **Lipostatic hypothesis**.<br>
: The idea that the brain monitors the amount of body fat, acting to defend this energy store against perturbations.

For this hypothesis to be true, a necessary condition is the communication from body fat to feeding behavior, i.e., from the adipose tissue to the brain.

This is confirmed by Douglas Coleman as follows:

##### Studies from ob/ob mice

ob/ob mice (lacking both copies of a gene called ob): very obese, abnormally motivated to eat.

Coleman's hypothesis: The product from the ob gene may be the hormone telling the brain that fat reserves are normal('enough').

1. Parabiosis experiment (1906s, Coleman & his colleagues)
   - parabiosis: First introduced by the French physiologist Paul Bert in the 1860s.
   - parabiosed entities share a *common blood supply*.
   - an ob/ob and normal mice were parabiosed => Feeding behavior and obesity were **greatly reduced**.
  
   : The effects by missing hormone?
2. Effects of leptin (1994, Jeffrey Friedman @ Rockfeller Univ.)
   - leptin: The protein encoded by the ob gene.
     - Generation & Secretion: adipose cells (adipocytes)
     - Target: Neurons of the **arcuate nucleus** of the **hypothalamus**.
     - 'body fat is enough'
     - Result:
       - Decrease appetite
       - Increase energy expenditure
   - Leptin deficiency: Adaptive when food is scarce & E reserves are low.
     - stimulate hunger & feeding
     - suppress energy expenditure
     - inhibit reproductive competence

##### The Hypothalamus & Feeding

- Lesion Experiment (Dr. Hetherington & Dr. Ranson)
  Bilateral lesions of...
  - *Lateral* hypothalamus
    ❗단어들❗

    | 단어 | 뜻 |
    | --- | --- |
    | anorexia | a state of negative energy balance in which energy expenditure exceeds energy intake, with a severe damage to food appetite |
    | lateral hypothalamic syndrome | anorexia caused by damage to the lateral hypothalamus |

  - *ventromedial* hypothalamus
    ❗단어들❗

    | 단어 | 뜻 |
    | --- | --- |
    | ventromedial hypothalamic syndrome | overeating and obesity caused by lesions to the ventromedial hypothalamus |

Dual center model:
- Lateral hypothalamus: "hunger center"
- Ventromedial hypothalamus: "satiety center"

Too simplistic!

##### The effects of leptin on the hypothalamus

❗단어들❗

| anoretic peptides | A neuroactive peptide that acts to inhibit feeding behavior; examples are CCK, αMSH, and CART. | orexigenic peptide | A neuroactive peptide that stimulates feeding behavior; examples are neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), melanin-concentrating hormone(MCH), and orexin. |

| arcuate nucleus | A nucleus in the periventricular area of the hypothalamus containing a large number of neurons sensitive to changes in leptin levels, contributing to the regulation of energy balance
| paraventricular nucleus | ??? |
| lateral hypothalamic area | ??? |

Fig 16.7

1. leptin activates leptin receptors on neurons of the **arcuate nucleus**.
2. activating *arcuate neurons* containing peptide ntms **αMSH** and **CART**, proportional to the blood leptin level.
3. The **αMSH/CART** neurons trigger *humoral* and *visceromotor* response via **paraventricular nucleus**.
   1. activate neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that causes the release of hypophysiotropic hormones that *facilitates* the *release of TSH and ACTH* from the anterior pituitary. (=> raising metabolic rate of cells throughout the body)
   2. The **paraventricular nucleus** also activate the *sympathetic ANS*
      1. with direct axonal projections to neurons in the lower brain stem and
      2. to preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord.
4. The **αMSH/CART** neurons also trigger behavorial response via the **lateral hypothalamus**. => inhibit feeding behavior

Fig 16.8

1. Fall in leptin => not only turn off **αMSH/CART** neurons, but also *stimulate* **NPY/AgRP neurons of the arcuate nucleus**.
2. The neuropeptides... (via **paraventricular nucleus**)
   1. inhibit the paraventricular nucleus that stimulate the release of TSH and ACTH.
   2. activate parasympathetic division of the ANS
3. It also, (via **lateral hypothalamus**)
   1. *Stimulate* feeding behavior

Fig 16.9

Note that AgRP(agonist) and αMSH(antagonist) are antagonistic neurotransmitters<br>
both binding to the **MC4 receptor** on some postsynaptic neurons in the hypothalamus.<br>
Activation of MC4 receptors on **lateral hypothalamic neurons** inhibit feeding; inhibition stimulates feeding.<br>

Fig 16.11

##### The Control of Feeding by Lateral Hypothalamic Peptides

Lateral hypothalamic area
- Not organized into well-defined nuclei.
- involved in motivating feeding behavior.

2 groups of neurons of **lateral hypothalamic neurons** with...
  - Direct input from arcuate nucleus
  - Widespread cortical connections in the brain

1. MCH (melanin-concentrating hormone)-containing neurons
   1. Direct monosynaptic innervation of *most* of the cerbral cortex.
      1. System in a strategic position to inform the cortex of leptin levels in the food.
      2. **Motivating search for food**. Evidences:
         1. Injection of MCH into the brain stimulates feeding behavior.
         2. MCH lacking mutant mice: less feeding behavior, lean(, elevated metabolic rate)
2. orexin(==hypocretin)-containing neurons
   1. Stimulates feeding behavior.
   2. as hypocretin : important in the regulation of *wakefulness*.

They are complementary. e.g.
- orexin: promotes meal initiation.
- MCH: prolongs consumption.

cf. disabling orexin (==hypocretin) signaling => **excessive daytime sleepiness**.

cf. orexin(hypocretin) provides an interesting link between the conditions...
1. sleep inhibits feeding behavior(less orexin).
2. insomnia and obesity often go together (excessive orexin).
