### Introduction

Communication in the nervous system
- point-to-point communication
  - Influence of one neuron is targeted to a small number of other neurons.
  - Tightly constrained in both space and time (a few msec)
  - e.g. sensory or motor systems.
- Communication with many cells
  - Slowly (seconds~minutes)
  - 

### 1. The Secretory Hypothalamus

#### 1.1. An Overview of the Hypothalamus
hypothalamus:
  - Location: Below the thalamus, along the walls of the third ventricle (forebrain)
  - Integrates somatic and visceral responses if needed.
  - Regulates internal condition of the body in response to a changing external environment: homeostasis.

##### 1.1.1. Homeostasis

  - Homeostasis: The maintenance of the body's internal environment within a narrow physiological range.
  - example:
    - Temperature regulation
      - Low
        - Blood vessles constrict => heat is conserved.
        - Sweat glands do not secrete fluid.
        - Turn blue: shunt blood *away from* surface tissues => keep sensitive core of the body warmer.
        - Shiver (involuntary contraction of muscles => generate heat in the muscles)
        - Goose bumps (a futile attempt to fluff up your nonexistent fur for better insulation. a reflexive remnant from harrier ancestors)
      - High
        - Blood vessles dilate => heat loss to env.
        - Sweat glands secrete fluid. (**evaporate** => heat is lost from the body)
        - Turn red: shunt blood *to* surface tissues where heat can radiate away.

##### 1.1.2. Structure and Connections of the Hypothalamus

3 zones:
- lateral, medial
  : Extensive connections with...
  - the brain stem
  - the telencephalon
  
  regulate certain types of behavior.

![Image of Structure of the hypothalamus. periventricular zone ](/images/ns14_hypothal-struct.png)

- periventricular
  - Location: Right next to the wall of the third ventricle.
  - Complex mix of neurons. e.g.
    - Supra Chiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)
      - Location: just above the optic chiasm.
      - Input: direct retinal innervation
      - Fn: Sync. circadian rhythms with daily light-dark cycle.
    - *neurosecretory* neurons
      - Control ANS
      - regulate pituitary gland.

#### 1.2. Pathways to the pituitary (Posterior and Anterior)

##### 1.2.1. Hypothalamic Control of the Posterior Potuitary

- Neurohormones: Substances released into the blood by neurons.
- the subfornical organ: a part of the telencephalong that lacks a BBB.

**magnocellular neurosecretory cells**

- extend axons down the stalk of the pituitary and into the **posterior** lobe.

![Magnocellular neurosecrtory cells of the hypothalamus](/images/ns14_hypothal-magno-n-cells.png)

release 2 kinds of **neurohormones** directly into the capillaries of the posterior lobe.

They have the following properties:

- peptides
- a chain of 9 aa.s

1. Oxytocin
   1. rise when...
      1. sexual/intimate behaviors
      2. somatic sensations generated by a suckling baby
         1. cortex informed by somatic, visual, or auditory pathways stimulates the hypothalamus to release oxytocin.
   2. Function
      1. Promote social bonding
      2. Cause the uterus to contract => facilitate the delivery
      3. Stimulates ejection of milk from the mammary glands

2. <span class="imp">Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH)</span>
   1. Trigger: (low blood volume <=> P, high blood salt concentration)
      1. Pressure receptors in the cardiovascular system (P is low => hypothalamus)
      2. Salt concentration-sensitive cells in the hypothalamus (C is high)
   2. Fn (Regulates blood volume and salt concentration)
      1. water retention
      2. reduced urine production
   3. Process
      1. low blood P in kidney
      2. kidney release renin
      3. renin converts Angiotensin from liver to angiotensin I => angiotensin II.
      4. Angiotensin II...
         1. Direct effect on kidneys & blood vessels
         2. <span class = "imp">Detected by the subfornical organ => </span>

##### 1.2.2. Hypothalamic Control of the Anterior Pituitary

Terms:
- hypophysiotropic hormone
  : A peptide hormone releasd into the blood by the parvocellular neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus; stimulates/inhibits the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary
- hypothalamo-pituitary portal circulation
  : A system/network of blood vessels that carries hypophysiotropic hormones from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary.
- adrenal cortex
- adrenal medulla
- 

Anterior Pituatary
- body's "master gland" (traditionally)
- NOT a part of the brain(CNS)
- Controlled by **parvocellular neurosecretory cells** of the periventricular hypothalamus by releasing the **hypophysiotropic hormones**. ("*true* master gland")

Example

- adrenal cortex produce **cortisol** (steroid)
- fn:
  - mobilize(=use) energy reserves of body
  - suppress immune system => cope with life's various stress.
- good stimulus for release: **stress**
  - physiological strss e.g. loss of blood
  - positive emotional stimulation. e.g. falling in love
  - phychological stress; anxity over an upcoming exam.

- stress is determined by the **parvocellular neurosecrtory cells** (by the release of cortisol) that control the adrenal cortex

Process

1. **parvocellular neurosecrtory cells** release *Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone* (CRH) into the blood of the portal circulation.
2. CRH travels to the anterior pituitary. stimulates the release of corticotropin(=**a**dreno**c**ortico**t**ropic **h**ormone (ACTH)) into the general circulation.
3. ACTH travels to the adrenal cortex, stimulating cortisol release.

| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| FSH; Follicle-Stimulating Hormone | Gonads | Ovulation, spermatogenesis |
| LH; Lutenizing Hormone | Gonads | Ovarian and sperm maturation |
| TSH; Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (=thyrotropin) | Thyroid | Thyroxin secretion ( => inc metabolic rate) |
| ACTH(adreno cortico tropic hormone) (=corticotropin) | Adrenal cortex | Cortisol secretion (mobilize E stores, inhibits immune system, etc.) |
| GH; growth hormone | All Cells | Stimulation of protein synthesis |
| Prolactin | Mammary glands | Growth and milk secretion |
